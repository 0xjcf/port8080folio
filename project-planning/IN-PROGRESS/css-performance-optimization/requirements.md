# CSS Performance Optimization Requirements

## Project Overview
**Component**: Landing Page CSS Architecture
**Purpose**: Optimize CSS performance, remove anti-patterns, and establish maintainable architecture
**Current State**: 225 CSS warnings from Biome, 130+ !important declarations, multiple color formats, duplicate styles

## Objectives
- Remove all unnecessary !important declarations (130+ instances)
- Achieve Lighthouse performance score > 95
- Reduce CSS bundle size < 50KB gzipped
- Establish consistent design token system
- Improve mobile rendering performance (60fps scrolling)
- Fix CSS cascade and specificity issues

## Scope

### Included
- Remove !important anti-patterns across all CSS files
- Implement CSS cascade layers architecture
- Standardize color system to OKLCH format
- Consolidate duplicate styles and mobile queries
- Fix class naming collisions (BEM convention)
- Optimize GPU-intensive effects for mobile
- Create z-index token scale
- Set up Biome for CSS linting
- Minify and optimize CSS delivery

### Excluded (MVP)
- JavaScript framework integration
- Complex animation libraries
- Server-side rendering
- CSS-in-JS solutions
- Advanced build pipelines (beyond PostCSS)
- Component library creation
- Design system documentation site

## Dependencies
- Biome 2.2.0 for linting/formatting
- PostCSS for build optimization
- Modern browser CSS features (@layer, OKLCH)
- Existing HTML structure must remain stable

## Constraints
- **Technical**: Must work on low-end mobile devices (2GB RAM)
- **Timeline**: 4-week implementation window
- **Resources**: Single developer, static hosting
- **Performance**: 
  - LCP < 2.5s on 3G Fast
  - CLS < 0.1
  - INP < 200ms
  - CSS < 50KB gzipped
- **Browser Support**: Modern evergreen browsers + Safari 15+
