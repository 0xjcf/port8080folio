# Progressive Enhancement & JavaScript Performance Requirements

## Project Overview
**Component**: Website JavaScript Architecture & Progressive Enhancement
**Purpose**: Ensure the website functions without JavaScript while progressively enhancing the experience when JS is available, with minimal performance impact
**Current State**: 
- Minimal JS for form tab switching (31 lines)
- Forms have error/success messages that require JS to show/hide
- Services carousel works with CSS-only but could benefit from JS enhancements
- No fallback for users with JS disabled

## Objectives
- **Core Functionality Without JS**: Website must be fully functional with JavaScript disabled
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Add JS features that enhance but don't break the experience
- **Performance First**: Minimize JavaScript bundle size and execution time
- **Accessibility**: Ensure all features work with assistive technologies

## Scope

### Included
- CSS-only fallbacks for all interactive elements
- Progressive enhancement strategy for forms
- Performance budget for JavaScript (< 1.5KB minified)
- Inline critical JS, defer non-critical
- Feature detection and graceful degradation
- `<noscript>` alternatives where needed
- Mailchimp newsletter form with no-JS redirect
- Contact form with server endpoint (not mailto:)
- Honeypot fields for spam prevention
- Custom thank-you pages for form submissions
- ARIA roles for accessibility

### Excluded (MVP)
- Complex form validation logic
- Real-time form submission AJAX
- Advanced animations/transitions
- Third-party analytics or tracking scripts
- Service workers or PWA features
- CAPTCHAs (using honeypot instead)
- Multiple Mailchimp forms on same page

## Dependencies
- HTML5 form validation attributes
- CSS :target pseudo-class for navigation
- CSS :checked pseudo-class for toggles
- Modern CSS features (already in use)
- Mailchimp form action URL and IDs
- Server endpoint for contact form (/api/contact)
- Email service (Resend/Postmark/SES) for contact form

## Constraints
- **Technical**: Must work in all modern browsers (>= 0.25% usage)
- **Performance**: Total JS < 1.5KB minified, < 50ms execution time
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Timeline**: Implementation within current sprint
- **Resources**: No external JS libraries/frameworks

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Website fully functional with JavaScript disabled
- [ ] JavaScript bundle < 5KB minified
- [ ] First Input Delay < 100ms
- [ ] No layout shifts from JS loading
- [ ] All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- [ ] Forms submit successfully without JS
- [ ] Progressive enhancement documented

## User Stories
- As a user with JS disabled, I want to navigate and use all features
- As a mobile user, I want fast interactions without delays
- As a user on slow connection, I want the site to be usable before JS loads
- As a screen reader user, I want all interactive elements properly announced

## Performance Metrics
- **JavaScript Size**: < 5KB minified, < 2KB gzipped
- **Parse Time**: < 10ms on average mobile device
- **Execution Time**: < 50ms for initial setup
- **Time to Interactive**: < 3s on 3G connection
- **No JavaScript blocking**: All JS deferred or async
