## Final Notes

Remember: Every word should either build trust or drive action. This is a landing page with one goal - convert qualified visitors into consultation calls. Keep content focused, genuine, and results-oriented.

The HTML-only approach means content must be perfect since we're not relying on flashy animations or effects. The words and their organization ARE the user experience.
