Target Audience: 6th-12th grade students

Success Criteria:
- makes life easier for teachers and students
- extremely easy to use for teachers and students
- provides a comprehensive and engaging learning experience

Platform: 
- Web 

AI/ML Capabilities:
- AI chatbot that can help navigate the website and provide answers to questions

Privacy / Compliance:
- add disclaimer to save the user's data

Add public resources section/page
- videos for each module would be here

Design Style:
- I'm in charge of the design for now
use chickenranchresort.com as a style guide

Accessibility Goals:
- support blind and hard of hearing users

Device Responsiveness:
- Desktop, tablet, and mobile

Analytics & Monitoring:
- Analytics for teachers to see how students are doing and if they are engaging with the content
- Analytics for students to see their progress
- How many users are using the website
- Due dates and time spent on each module



Notes:
- we need to add validation for required answers before the student can progress through the module.
- we need to add a way to track the student's progress through the module.
- we need to figure out how to figure out who is a tribal admin and who is not and how to add them to the database.

TODO:
- [ ] sign contract and send it to Kayla.


From transcript:
Below is a concise summary of the conversation along with the major highlights:

1. **Target Launch Date & Timeline**  
   - The project is planned to start in early April and launch around early October 2025, giving a development window of about six months.

2. **Primary Goal & Use Case**  
   - Build a website that provides educational modules on social issues for students in grades 6–12.  
   - Each module includes videos and questionnaires/surveys.  
   - Questionnaire responses can flag potential concerns, notifying an administrator for follow-up.

3. **“Plug-and-Play”/Modular Design**  
   - Admins can create new modules without needing a developer, adding videos, questionnaire forms, and other content.  
   - The vision is somewhat analogous to a “Google Slides” style of editor, where content can be easily rearranged or updated.

4. **Intended Users & Dashboards**  
   - **Public Visitors**: Access only public-facing modules or videos without the questionnaire or reporting functionality.  
   - **Students**: Access only the modules assigned by their teacher. They must answer questions correctly before proceeding to the next slide/page.  
   - **Teachers**: Assign modules to students, track completion and due dates, and view analytics on who has finished assignments.  
   - **School Administrators**: Manage which teachers have access and designate emergency contacts for flagged questionnaire results.  
   - **Tribal Administrators**: Manage overall module creation and can see global analytics (e.g., how many schools or students are using the system).

5. **Analytics & Tracking**  
   - For teachers: See which students have accessed and completed assignments.  
   - For tribal/school admins: Track overall usage statistics, such as number of participants and module utilization.  
   - Potential for Google Analytics-style visitor tracking to see how users navigate the site and how many people access modules.

6. **Privacy & Compliance**  
   - The site will need disclaimers and possibly additional disclaimers in each module, letting students know their answers are not private if they require intervention.  
   - Accessibility is important (screen reader support, closed captions) to accommodate various user needs.

7. **Design & Style**  
   - The site should be modern, clean, and inspired by the Chicken Ranch Casino Resort website’s design aesthetics (without appearing like a casino).  
   - Priority on ease of use so teachers (who are often short on time) can quickly learn and deploy modules.

8. **Device Support**  
   - The site should be responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile users, as many students or teachers may only have mobile or tablet access.

9. **AI/Machine Learning (Optional)**  
   - AI could be used to help navigate the system, but it is not a core requirement.

10. **User Registration Flow & Role Verification**  
   - Important to control who can become a tribal admin or school admin so students do not accidentally register themselves as administrators.  
   - Likely requires an invitation-based system:  
     - Tribal admins invite designated new tribal admins.  
     - School admins invite new teacher accounts.  
     - Teachers invite students for module access.

11. **Next Steps**  
   - Signing the contract.  
   - Working out final details on user onboarding logic and admin verification.  
   - Begin development with a focus on delivering a prototype soon for review.

**Key Highlights**  
- A six-month development timeline (April to October 2025).  
- Modular, “plug-and-play” content management.  
- Multiple dashboards for different user roles (tribal admin, school admin, teacher, student, and public).  
- Questionnaires with mandatory correct answers to progress.  
- Analytics for usage tracking and assignment completion.  
- Accessibility (screen readers, closed captions) and responsive design are top priorities.  
- Invitation-based or tightly controlled admin roles to prevent unauthorized access.  
- Inspiration from Chicken Ranch Casino Resort site for look and feel.
