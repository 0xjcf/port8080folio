        <h2>How I think, how I work, and why behavior matters</h2>
        <p>
          I’m Jose Flores — a software engineer and technical advisor focused on helping teams ship complex systems
          with confidence. I specialize in making behavior explicit so teams can reason about change, reduce risk, and
          move faster without chaos.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="about__section">
        <h2>My background (the short version)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Product teams shipping customer-facing systems.</li>
          <li>Founders navigating scale and technical uncertainty.</li>
          <li>Local businesses turning websites into reliable lead engines.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The pattern is consistent: teams don’t stall because of code quality — they stall because expectations are
          unclear and behavior is hard to reason about.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="about__section">
        <h2>How I think about software</h2>
        <p>
          Most complexity comes from hidden assumptions. When behavior lives only in people’s heads or scattered across
          components, teams slow down, bugs repeat, and decisions get revisited endlessly.
        </p>
        <p>I make behavior visible and shared by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Modeling flows with statecharts.</li>
          <li>Structuring systems using the actor model.</li>
          <li>Turning assumptions into scenarios you can test.</li>
          <li>Writing decisions in plain English so they don’t drift.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This doesn’t add overhead — it removes friction.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="about__section">
        <h2>How I work with teams</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Clarity matters more than speed theater.</li>
          <li>Decisions are documented, not tribal.</li>
          <li>Collaboration beats heroics.</li>
          <li>Shipping sustainably is the goal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I don’t arrive with a fixed framework or agenda. I help teams choose the smallest tool that solves the real
          problem — whether that’s a workshop, advisory support, or hands-on engineering.
        </p>

      <section class="about__section">
        <h2>What people usually notice</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I ask the right questions early.</li>
          <li>I explain tradeoffs clearly and calmly.</li>
          <li>I reduce ambiguity instead of adding process.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>My goal is always the same:</strong> make future work easier, not harder.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="about__section">
        <h2>Open source and teaching</h2>
        <p>
          I maintain and contribute to open-source projects like Actor-Web and Ignite-Element. These tools exist
          because I care about developer experience and systems that scale cognitively, not just technically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teaching and writing help me sharpen these ideas — and help others avoid the mistakes I’ve already made.

      <section class="about__section">
        <h2>Who I work best with</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Clear thinking over buzzwords.</li>
          <li>Explicit behavior over implicit assumptions.</li>
          <li>Collaboration over control.</li>
          <li>Long-term stability over short-term hacks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you want someone to take over decision-making entirely, I’m probably not the right fit. If you want a
          partner who helps you think clearly and ship confidently, we should talk.
