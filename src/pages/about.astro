        <h2>How I think, how I work, and why behavior matters</h2>
        <p>
          I’m Jose Flores, a software engineer and technical advisor. I focus on
          helping teams ship complex systems with confidence. I started making
          behavior explicit after watching how quickly things drift when the
          decisions stayed implicit.
        </p>
        <p>That shift still shapes how I work.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="about__section">
        <h2>My background (the short version)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Product teams shipping customer-facing systems.</li>
          <li>Founders navigating scale and technical uncertainty.</li>
          <li>Local businesses turning websites into reliable lead engines.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In the teams I worked with, the stalls were rarely about code quality.
          What I kept seeing was unclear expectations and behavior that was hard
          to reason about.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="about__section">
        <h2>How I think about software</h2>
        <p>
          A lot of complexity I ran into came from hidden assumptions. When
          behavior lived only in people’s heads or scattered across components,
          teams slowed down, bugs repeated, and decisions got revisited
          endlessly.
        </p>
        <p>I make behavior visible and shared by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Modeling flows with statecharts.</li>
          <li>Structuring systems using the actor model.</li>
          <li>Turning assumptions into scenarios you can test.</li>
          <li>Writing decisions in plain English so they don’t drift.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In practice, this doesn’t add overhead. It removes friction.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="about__section">
        <h2>How I work with teams</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Clarity matters more than speed.</li>
          <li>Decisions are documented, not tribal.</li>
          <li>Collaboration beats heroics.</li>
          <li>Shipping sustainably is the goal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I don’t arrive with a fixed framework or agenda. I help teams choose
          the smallest tool that solves the real problem. That might be a
          workshop, advisory support, or hands-on engineering, depending on what
          the system is asking for.
        </p>

      <section class="about__section">
        <h2>What people usually notice</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I ask the right questions early.</li>
          <li>I explain tradeoffs clearly and calmly.</li>
          <li>I reduce ambiguity instead of adding process.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>My goal is always the same:</strong> make future work easier, not
          harder.
        </p>

      <section class="about__section">
        <h2>Open source and teaching</h2>
        <p>
          I maintain and contribute to open-source projects like Actor-Web and
          Ignite-Element. These tools exist because I care about developer
          experience and systems that scale cognitively, not just technically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teaching and writing help me sharpen these ideas. They also help
          others avoid the mistakes I’ve already made.

      <section class="about__section">
        <h2>Who I tend to work best with</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Teams that value clear thinking over buzzwords.</li>
          <li>Projects where behavior is made explicit instead of assumed.</li>
          <li>
            Collaborative environments where decisions are shared, not
            centralized.
          </li>
          <li>
            Work that prioritizes long-term stability over short-term fixes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The engagements that have gone best for me are the ones where I’m
          brought in as a thinking partner, not just someone to take over
          decisions. If that kind of collaboration resonates, the writing and
          open-source work here will give you a good sense of how I operate.

          If you want to go deeper, start with the Behavior &amp; Boundaries
          series. I usually point people to
          <em>When Code Becomes Cheap</em> first.
