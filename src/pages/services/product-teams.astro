        <p class="lead section__subtitle">
          Modern product teams struggle when system behavior is implicit and hard to reason about. I make behavior
          explicit so changes are safer, delivery is steadier, and everyone aligns on what should happen before code
          ships.
        </p>
      </header>

      <section class="service-detail__section">
        <h2>When this is a good fit</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Core flows are complex and difficult to explain.</li>
          <li>Bugs return because behavior is implicit.</li>
          <li>Changes feel risky and slow to ship.</li>
          <li>Product and engineering disagree on expected behavior.</li>
          <li>You’ve refactored the same areas more than once.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If complexity is slowing you down, you don’t need more process—you need clarity at the behavior level.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="service-detail__section">
        <h2>My approach</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Model critical flows with statecharts (XState).</li>
          <li>Structure systems using the actor model.</li>
          <li>Make assumptions explicit and testable.</li>
          <li>Choose the smallest tool that actually works.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The result isn’t more abstraction—it’s less accidental complexity and fewer rework loops.</p>

      <section class="service-detail__section">
        <h2>How I help</h2>

        <h3>XState + Actor Model Workshop</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for teams aligning on complex behavior.</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Map 1–2 critical user or system flows.</li>
          <li>Define states, events, and failure paths.</li>
          <li>Model behavior using statecharts and actors (TypeScript).</li>
          <li>Leave templates and examples your team can reuse.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Typical outcome:</strong> A shared mental model and requirements everyone can reason about.</p>

        <h3>Architecture & Technical Advisory</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for teams navigating change or scale.</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Review delivery risks and current architecture.</li>
          <li>Clarify boundaries, ownership, and responsibilities.</li>
          <li>Turn uncertainty into documented decisions that stick.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Typical outcome:</strong> Clearer tradeoffs and steadier delivery.</p>

        <h3>Embedded Engineering (Contract / C2H)</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for teams that need hands-on help.</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ship production features inside your codebase.</li>
          <li>Model behavior explicitly with XState and actors.</li>
          <li>Add scenario-based tests and durable docs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Typical outcome:</strong> Real progress without new complexity or dependencies.</p>

      <section class="service-detail__section">
        <h2>What teams value most</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I explain tradeoffs in plain English.</li>
          <li>I focus on behavior before tools.</li>
          <li>I leave systems easier to evolve than I found them.</li>

        <h2>What this is not</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A quick UI reskin.</li>

          <li>Heavy process over clear models.</li>
          <li>Someone taking over decisions entirely.</li>

      <section class="service-detail__section">
        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Quick fit call:</strong> Clarify goals, constraints, and success.</li>
          <li><strong>Clear plan:</strong> Scope, outcomes, and next steps.</li>
          <li><strong>Execution:</strong> Ship with explicit behavior and documented decisions.</li>
