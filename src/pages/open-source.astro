        <h2>Tools, patterns, and ideas built in the open</h2>
        <p>
          I maintain and contribute to open-source projects because I care about
          clarity, explicit behavior, and systems that scale cognitively.
          Technical scale matters too. Open source is where I test ideas,
          sharpen patterns, and share what works in real products.
        </p>
        <p>
          These projects are where the questions in my writing get exercised
          under real constraints.

        <h2>Why I build in the open</h2>
        <p>
          In the systems I worked on, the problems that stayed with me were
          about unclear behavior, hidden assumptions, and systems that were hard
          to reason about.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started building in the open after noticing those patterns repeat:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Explore better ways to model behavior.</li>
          <li>Reduce accidental complexity.</li>
          <li>Improve developer experience.</li>
          <li>Share patterns that survive real-world constraints.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          Ignite-Element
          <span class="open-source__badge">Start here</span>
        </h3>
        <p><strong>Behavior-first web components.</strong></p>
        <p>
          Ignite-Element bridges state machines and custom elements, making it
          easier to build UI components whose behavior is explicit and testable.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Statecharts as the source of truth</li>
          <li>Clear separation of behavior and rendering</li>
          <li>Reduced state drift</li>
          <li>Components that scale with complexity</li>

        <p class="open-source__eyebrow">Foundational work</p>
        <h3>Actor-Web</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>A pure actor-model runtime for JavaScript/TypeScript.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Actor-Web is a minimal actor system inspired by Erlang/OTP. It helps
          you build resilient, message-driven JS/TS systems with
          location-transparent actors. It’s not a UI framework. It’s a
          foundation for reasoning about concurrency, boundaries, and lifecycles
          across client and server environments.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Actor-based boundaries and ownership</li>
          <li>Message-driven communication (bounded mailboxes)</li>
          <li>Predictable lifecycles and explicit failure handling</li>
          <li>Systems that stay debuggable as complexity grows</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If Ignite-Element is how these ideas land in UI components, Actor-Web
          is where they’re stress-tested at the system level.

        <h2>How this connects to my work</h2>
        <p>
          These projects aren’t side hobbies. They extend how I think about
          systems. Open-source work informs my workshops. It shapes my advisory
          approach. It improves the tools I bring into client environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are the practical side of the same ideas I explore in <em
            >Behavior &amp; Boundaries</em
          >.

        <h2>Who this is for</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Explicit system behavior</li>
          <li>Statecharts and the actor model</li>
          <li>Long-term maintainability</li>
          <li>Developer experience that scales</li>
          <li>Learning through real examples, not theory</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If that resonates, you’re in the right place.</p>

        <h2>Supporting the work</h2>
        <p>
          I split my time between client work and open source. Sponsorships and
          community support help keep these projects moving forward.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Star or contribute on GitHub.</li>
          <li>Sponsor development when possible.</li>
