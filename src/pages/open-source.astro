        <h2>Tools, patterns, and ideas built in the open</h2>
        <p>
          I maintain and contribute to open-source projects because I care about clarity, explicit behavior, and
          systems that scale cognitively—not just technically. Open source is where I test ideas, sharpen patterns,
          and share what actually works in real products.

      <section class="open-source__section">
        <h2>Why I build in the open</h2>
        <p>
          Most production issues don’t come from a lack of libraries. They come from unclear behavior, hidden
          assumptions, and systems that are hard to reason about.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Explore better ways to model behavior.</li>
          <li>Reduce accidental complexity.</li>
          <li>Improve developer experience.</li>
          <li>Share patterns that survive real-world constraints.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Featured projects</h2>

        <h3>Actor-Web</h3>
        <p><strong>A lightweight actor runtime for frontend systems.</strong></p>
        <p>
          Actor-Web explores how the actor model can be applied to frontend architecture in a way that’s explicit,
          composable, and easy to reason about.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Actor-based boundaries</li>
          <li>Message-driven communication</li>
          <li>Clear ownership of behavior</li>
          <li>Predictable lifecycle management</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ignite-Element</h3>
        <p><strong>Behavior-first web components.</strong></p>
        <p>
          Ignite-Element bridges state machines and custom elements, making it easier to build UI components whose
          behavior is explicit and testable.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Statecharts as the source of truth</li>
          <li>Clear separation of behavior and rendering</li>
          <li>Reduced state drift</li>
          <li>Components that scale with complexity</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How this connects to my work</h2>
        <p>
          These projects aren’t side hobbies—they’re extensions of how I think about systems. Open-source work informs
          my workshops, shapes my advisory approach, and improves the tools I bring into client environments.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="open-source__section">
        <h2>Who this is for</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Explicit system behavior</li>
          <li>Statecharts and the actor model</li>
          <li>Long-term maintainability</li>
          <li>Developer experience that scales</li>
          <li>Learning through real examples, not theory</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If that resonates, you’re in the right place.</p>

        <h2>Supporting the work</h2>
        <p>
          I split my time between client work and open source. Sponsorships and community support help keep these
          projects moving forward.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Star or contribute on GitHub.</li>
          <li>Sponsor development when possible.</li>
