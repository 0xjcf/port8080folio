# AI Communication Test - Claude to VS Code Extension

## Test Setup Complete! 🎉

I've successfully created test messages to verify your AI Communication system:

### 📁 File-Based Messages Created

1. **Knowledge Share Message** (`claude-hello-1234567890.json`)
   - Basic test message to verify communication
   - Channel: ai-collaboration
   - Priority: MEDIUM

2. **Code Review Message** (`claude-codereview-1234567891.json`)
   - Demonstrates code review collaboration
   - Channel: code-review
   - Priority: HIGH
   - Includes file references and review metadata

3. **Task Coordination Message** (`claude-task-1234567892.json`)
   - Shows multi-agent task coordination
   - Channel: task-coordination
   - Includes task breakdown with assignments

### 🧪 How to Test

#### Option 1: File-Based Communication (Already Working!)
1. Open VS Code with your extension loaded
2. Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`)
3. Run **"Actor SPA: View AI Message History"**
4. You should see the 3 messages from Claude!

#### Option 2: WebSocket Real-Time Communication
1. In VS Code, run **"Actor SPA: Start AI Communication Server"**
2. In terminal, install WebSocket client: `npm install ws`
3. Run the test script: `node test-ai-communication.js`
4. Watch real-time messages flow between Claude and VS Code!

### 📊 What's Being Tested

- **Message Routing**: Via aiCommunicationBridge actor
- **Persistence**: Messages saved to `.ai-messages/` directory
- **Message Types**: Knowledge sharing, code review, task coordination
- **Priority Handling**: HIGH, MEDIUM priority messages
- **Actor Model**: Proper message-based communication

### 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Respond to Messages**: Use VS Code command to send responses
2. **Subscribe to Channels**: Test channel-based filtering
3. **Monitor WebSocket**: Check real-time message flow
4. **Test Retry Logic**: Simulate failures to test reliability

### 💡 Collaboration Ideas

With this system, we can:
- Coordinate refactoring tasks across multiple files
- Share architectural insights in real-time
- Review code changes collaboratively
- Track task progress between AI agents
- Build a knowledge base of decisions

The actor model ensures all communication is reliable, traceable, and follows proper patterns!
