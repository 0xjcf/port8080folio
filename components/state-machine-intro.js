          You know that feeling when adding "just one more feature" breaks three others? When fixing a bug creates two more? 
          When your code becomes so complex that even you read it and are afraid to touch it?
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle" style="margin-top: 20px;">
          <strong>You're not alone.</strong> I've seen codebases with 1,700-line components, impossible-to-trace bugs, 
          and developers who'd rather quit than debug their own creation. The problem? Your app's complexity has 
          outgrown your architecture.
