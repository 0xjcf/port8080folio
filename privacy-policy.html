      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit my
        personal website (the "Site").</p>

      <h2>Personal Information I Collect</h2>

      <p>When you visit the Site, I may automatically collect certain information about your device, including
        information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your
        device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, I collect information about the individual web pages that you
        view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the
        Site. I refer to this automatically-collected information as "Device Information."</p>

      <p>I collect Device Information using the following technologies:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>"Cookies" are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique
          identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit <a
            href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.
        </li>
        <li>"Log files" track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type,
          Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Additionally, when you use the contact form on the Site, I collect your email address. I refer to this
        information as "Contact Information."</p>

      <p>When I talk about "Personal Information" in this Privacy Policy, I am talking both about Device Information and
        Contact Information.</p>

      <h2>How I Use Your Personal Information</h2>

      <p>I use the Contact Information that I collect to communicate with you and respond to your inquiries. I use the
        Device Information that I collect to help improve and optimize my Site (for example, by generating analytics
        about how visitors browse and interact with the Site). This information helps me understand what content is most
        valuable and how to improve the user experience.</p>

      <h2>Sharing Your Personal Information</h2>

      <p>I share your Device Information with third parties to help analyze and use this information, as described
        above. Specifically, I use Google Analytics to help me understand how visitors use the Site. Google Analytics
        collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit, and what other sites they
        used prior to coming to this site.</p>

      <p>I use the information I get from Google Analytics only to improve this site. Google Analytics collects only the
        IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying
        information. I do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally
        identifiable information.</p>

      <p>You can read more about how Google uses your Personal Information here: <a
          href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a>. You can also opt-out of Google Analytics
        here: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>

      <p>Additionally, I use Google Fonts to enhance the visual appearance of the Site. Google Fonts may collect
        information about your browsing session to serve the appropriate fonts. You can learn more about Google Fonts
        privacy practices here: <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq#privacy" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener">https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq#privacy</a>.</p>

      <p>I do not share your Contact Information with any third parties.</p>

      <p>Finally, I may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond
        to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information I receive, or to otherwise protect my
        rights.</p>

      <h2>Do Not Track</h2>
      <p>I respect your browser's "Do Not Track" setting. If this setting is enabled, my Site will not load analytics
        tracking scripts, and no data will be sent to Google Analytics.</p>

      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>If you are a European resident, you have the right to access personal information I hold about you and to ask
        that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to exercise this right,
        please contact me through the contact form on the Site.</p>

      <p>Additionally, if you are a European resident, I note that I am processing your information in order to pursue
        my legitimate business interests listed above or to respond to your inquiries. Please note that your information
        will be transferred outside of Europe, including to the United States.</p>

      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>When you contact me through the Site, I will maintain your Contact Information for my records unless and until
        you ask me to delete this information. For Device Information, I will retain this data for a period of up to 26
        months, which is the default retention period for Google Analytics.</p>

      <h2>Cookie Preferences</h2>
      <p>You can adjust your cookie preferences at any time by clicking on the "Cookie Preferences" button at the bottom
        of the website or by <a href="#" onclick="resetConsent(); return false;">clicking here</a>.</p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>I may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to my practices or
        for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.</p>

      <h2>Contact Me</h2>
      <p>For more information about my privacy practices, if you have questions, or if you would like to make a
        complaint, please contact me through the contact form on the homepage or through GitHub or LinkedIn using the
        links in the navigation bar.</p>
