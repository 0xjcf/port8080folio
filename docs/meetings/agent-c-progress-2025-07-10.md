# Agent C Progress Update - 2025-07-10

## Executive Summary

Agent C has completed significantly more work than indicated in the previous meeting notes. All major test specifications have been written following TDD principles.

## Completed Deliverables

### 1. Test Infrastructure ✅
- `src/framework/testing/actor-test-utils.ts` - Comprehensive test utilities with:
  - `MockActorRef` implementation with full interface
  - `TestEnvironment` for managing test actors
  - Helper functions for async testing
  - Benchmark utilities for performance testing

### 2. Type Definitions ✅
- `src/framework/core/actors/types.ts` - Complete actor system types:
  - Core interfaces (ActorRef, ActorBehavior, ActorSnapshot)
  - Supervision types and strategies
  - Mailbox interface
  - Observable types
  - Type guards

- `src/framework/core/messaging/message-types.ts` - Messaging infrastructure:
  - Message interfaces with metadata
  - Request/Response message types
  - System and lifecycle messages
  - Message factory functions
  - Type guards for messages

### 3. Test Specifications (TDD Red Phase) ✅
All tests written with `.todo()` specs and failing implementations:

- `src/framework/core/actors/actor-ref.test.ts` - Complete ActorRef test suite:
  - Basic operations (send, queue, snapshot)
  - Ask pattern with timeout
  - Observable state changes
  - Child actor spawning
  - Lifecycle management

- `src/framework/core/actors/mailbox.test.ts` - Mailbox implementation tests:
  - BoundedMailbox with FIFO ordering
  - PriorityMailbox with priority queuing
  - Backpressure strategies
  - Performance benchmarks

- `src/framework/core/observables/observable.test.ts` - Observable pattern tests:
  - Basic Observable creation and subscription
  - Factory methods (of, from, interval)
  - Subject and BehaviorSubject
  - Subscription management

- `src/framework/core/observables/operators.test.ts` - Comprehensive operator tests:
  - Transformation operators (map, filter, flatMap, scan)
  - Combination operators (merge, combineLatest)
  - Utility operators (tap, take, skip, debounce)
  - Error handling operators (catchError, retry)

### 4. Test Fixtures ✅
- `src/framework/testing/fixtures/actor-behaviors.ts`:
  - Counter, Toggle, List behaviors
  - Async behavior patterns
  - Parent-child behaviors
  - Error testing behaviors

- `src/framework/testing/fixtures/test-data.ts`:
  - Event generators
  - Message generators
  - Snapshot generators
  - Performance data generators
  - Delay utilities

## Remaining Work

### High Priority
1. `request-response.test.ts` - Tests for Agent A's request/response pattern
2. `supervisor.test.ts` - Tests for Agent A's supervisor implementation

### Medium Priority
3. Integration test scenarios
4. Performance benchmark implementation (utilities exist, needs scenarios)

### Low Priority
5. Documentation examples
6. Additional test fixtures as needed

## Branch Status

- Branch: `feature/actor-ref-tests`
- Status: All work committed and pushed
- Commit: `a80ef49` - "feat(actor-ref): add test utilities, types, and test specs for TDD"

## Dependencies

### Waiting For:
- **From Agent A**: ActorRef, Request/Response, and Supervisor implementations
- **From Agent B**: Observable, Mailbox implementations

### Providing To:
- **All Agents**: Type definitions and test utilities
- **Agent A & B**: Test specs to validate their implementations

## Notes

- All tests follow TDD principles with clear test-first approach
- Tests include comprehensive edge cases and error scenarios
- Performance benchmarks included for critical paths
- Type definitions are comprehensive and well-documented

## Next Steps

1. Coordinate with Agent A and B to ensure type compatibility
2. Write remaining tests for request-response and supervisor
3. Create integration test scenarios once core implementations exist
4. Set up continuous test runs for all agent branches
